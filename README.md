IMPORTANT ! Please read 'README' file before using this app.

This is a chat application in which you will see 5 messages already displayed on your screen as they are coming from the constructor which has been created in the 'Chat' class.

Some important points -

1. User can send a message by pressing enter or click on the 'User Send' button.
2. Agent can send a message by only clicking on the 'Agent Send' button.
3. The scrollbar will automatically comes at the bottom everytime you send a new message.
4. I have used 'moment.js' to parse time into 'x time ago' format.
5. I have used JQuery as a library to make this project.
